# BattleshipGame

This is a version of the board game Battleship where 2 AIs compete against each other in a large number of matches to determine which of them is the better AI. I have invited a bunch of you to this repo, feel free to clone it. When this game is ready for you to make an AI, there will be a folder called "DummyAI" that will serve as a template containing the proper interface for you to modify, and it will act as your test dummy during development. Your AI should be in a separate repo called "BattleshipAI". You should probably make it private ;)
